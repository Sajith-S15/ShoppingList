        <p>Dear Shori Sims,</p>

        <p>
          Congratulations on successfully completing your trial period at Tech
          IS! We're beyond excited to have you with us as you embark on this
          transformative learning journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          During your trial, you got a taste of our Python learning material. As
          you transition into the main course, you're gearing up for a deeper
          dive into Web Development. This comprehensive training is tailored to
          your initial commitment and is designed to equip you with specialized
          skills and expertise in your chosen field.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Cohort Details and Personal Tutor:</strong> Your cohort,
          <em> <b> #cohort-wd5-morning-evening</b></em

          >, who guided you through the process and helped you transition into
          the main course. Remember, while classes can be adjusted to your
